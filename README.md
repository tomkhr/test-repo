# test-repo
 In class demonstration of how to open a repo with Dan the instructor.

 This is my first GitHub project. It is helping me to remember HTML and CSS and how those languages work.

USEFUL: Create a template.html file that has all the basic HTML code that is needed to start an HTML document so you can duplicate and have a quicker start everytime when writing a new HTML doc.


To see a rendered html/css/js code in the browser we need to use GitHub Pages. Go to Settings of your repo >> Pages >> choose branch (main) and hit Save.
-- To Access the rendered code go to: https://tomkhr.github.io/test-repo/ (or USERNAME.github.io/REPO-NAME).
