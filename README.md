# test-repo
 In class demonstration of how to open a repo with Dan the instructor.

 This is my first GitHub project. It is helping me to remember HTML and CSS and how those languages work.

USEFUL: Create a template.html file that has all the basic HTML code that is needed to start an HTML document so you can duplicate and have a quicker start everytime when writing a new HTML doc.
